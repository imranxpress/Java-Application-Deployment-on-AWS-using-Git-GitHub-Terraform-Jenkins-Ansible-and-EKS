# Java-Application-Deployment-on-AWS-using-Git-GitHub-Terraform-Jenkins-Ansible-and-EKS
End-to-End Setup for Java Application Deployment on AWS using Git, GitHub, Terraform, Jenkins, Ansible, and EKS.


My task is to build a Java application. I will use Git as the version control system and GitHub as the source code manager. Iâ€™ll also use Terraform as the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool on AWS. First, Terraform will be used to provision a Jenkins server, as Jenkins is our CI/CD tool of choice. The Jenkins server will have Maven installed for building the Java application. I will use Terraform to provision an Ansible server and, additionally, to set up an EKS bootstrap server on AWS. This bootstrap server will be used to set up and configure our Kubernetes cluster on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
